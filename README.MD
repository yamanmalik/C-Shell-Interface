This program mimics the operations of a bash shell, written in C. It needs to be ran in a UNIX environment.
The shell supports basic shell commands as well as a history function (!!) which repeats the previous command. 
It also supports input/output redirection as well as command piping. To run, run the make file to compile by typing 
'make' in the directory you save, then run the shell with ./main.
